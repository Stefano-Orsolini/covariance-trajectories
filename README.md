# covariance-trajectories
Plot realtime trajectories from covariance matrix values.

Inspired by the work or Alexandre Barachant on Riemannian geometry and the his pyRiemann python library [1].

Acknowledgement:
Luca Talevi introduced me to the paper and explained the concept to me with numerous discussions and copious fun.
